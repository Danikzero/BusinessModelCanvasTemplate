            <h4>Customer Relationship</h4>
            <ul>
            	<li>Customers would have very little direct communication with the owners/developers,
            		however the site would be very simple and self explanatory, allowing for simple set up
            		and satisfied users.</li>
            	Automated services / self service.  We're providing automated services that customers can use at their own discretion.
            </ul>

            <h4>Customer Segments</h4>
            <ul>
            	<li>Customers need to be able to log in and set up their notifications easily</li>
            	<li>Users would rely on the group and others in their neighborhood to make the site
            		successful.</li>
            Target customers are people living in the salt lake area.  We are creating value particularly for those in neighborhood watch programs for their local neighborhood.

            <h4>Key Resources</h4>
            <ul>
            	<li>Users may need to be notified if their group has not logged on in over a week or a month,
            		as the site's benefit and success depends on the neighborhood users.</li>
            	Our developers, to build needed software.  Email and web services, to provide comunication for customers.

            <h4>Channels</h4>
            <ul>
            	<li>Social Networking will be a major assest in the website.</li>
				<li>Satisfied users will speak publicly about their new found security and neighborhood connection</li>
		Advertising is limited to word of mouth. All other channels are via a website.
            </ul>

            <h4>Cost Structure</h4>
            <ul>
            	<li>Membership Would be Free</li>
            	<li>Time available will be the deciding cost for each member of the group.</li>
            	<li>Website domain, hardware, server/site hosting, will carry a cost.</li>
            We are value driven, and have few costs.  Providing notifications via our key partnership with phone service providers appears to be our potentially largest cost.  Otherwise, costs of website maintenance may be a thing.
            </ul>
          </td>
          <td colspan="5">
            <h4>Revenue Streams</h4>
            <ul>
            	<li>Car and Classified websites will be able to have custom advertisements 
            		of listing in the neighborhood of the group, making sales much more convienent and local</li>
        		<li>Local Realtors would be able to post their picture, ad, or bio, for when the user is 
        			interested in selling their home or moving.</li>
    			<li>Insurance companies would advertise on the site, for renter's and property insurance,
    				and auto insurance. They could offer competitive discounts to the users, since the site 
    				is technically providing better security for their property.</li>
    	The initial price of the application is our only source of revenue. The Application is a matter of additional convenience and ease for a somewhat niche group. I think a price between $2 - $5 is realistic.
