            <h4>Cost Structure</h4>
            <p>We are value driven, and have few costs.  Providing notifications via our key partnership with phone
		service providers appears to be our potentially largest cost.  Otherwise, costs of website maintenance
		may be a thing.

          <td colspan="5">
            <h4>Revenue Streams</h4>
            <p>The initial price of the application is our only source of revenue. The Application is a matter 
		of additional convenience and ease for a somewhat niche group. I think a price between $2 - $5 is
		realistic.
